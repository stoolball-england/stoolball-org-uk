So if a player is missing, find the scorecard for a match where they played and add the scorecard.</p>\n<h2>A player's name is misspelled or incomplete</h2>\n<p>Often the person scoring doesn't know the full name or correct spelling of a player's name. If a player is listed on your team with a misspelled or incomplete name and you want to change it, you can rename the player. <strong>This only works if the name you want to use is not already listed. If it is, see 'The same player is listed with two or more different names' below.</strong></p>\n<p>To do this, you must be signed in and have permissions to manage your team. Go to the 'Players' tab on your team page and click the 'Edit players' link. Find the player you want to rename and click on their name. Once you've updated it, it may take a couple of hours for all statistics tables to be updated.</p>\n<h2>The same player is listed with two or more different names</h2>\n<p>This happens when a name is misspelled or incomplete. It also happens when someone changes their name, usually when they get married.</p>\n<p>Ask the player to create an account on this website and follow the guidance on <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/2f3fe275c1584e12824d4a32beacb0c7}\" title=\"Combine your statistics when you play for multiple teams or change your name\">Combine your statistics when you play for multiple teams or change your name</a>.

You can filter results and statistics by date if you want to exclude older matches.</p>\n<p>The list of players on the 'Players' tab of your team page is a list of the players who have been named on scorecards. Therefore the only way to remove a player is to remove them from all of the scorecards on which they appear.</p>\n<p>You should consider carefully before doing this. If you alter a scorecard you are changing the statistics not only for the player you're removing, but also for players on the opposition - for example a bowler who got them out loses a wicket, which changes their bowling average. You're also rewriting history. Scorecards on our website are a record of the history of the game, used by players today and family history researchers in the future. </p>"
