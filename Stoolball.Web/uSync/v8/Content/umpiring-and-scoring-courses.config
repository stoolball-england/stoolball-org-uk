      "text": "<p>Our courses for stoolball umpires and scorers are typically held together. The two groups learn their subjects in separate indoor sessions, then come together outside (weather permitting) to umpire and score a practice match.</p>\n<p>The umpiring course cover the practical side of umpiring, such as where to stand and how to signal, and guidance on matters that require the umpire's opinion. Scorers will learn to handle unusual scenarios correctly as well as the more common ones. The aim is not to teach the rules of stoolball, so attendees should have at least a basic understanding of the rules before they come.</p>\n<p>These courses take place once or twice per year according to demand and the availability of tutors. The ideal number for umpiring courses is 10-12 people, and 4-6 people for the scoring course.</p>\n<p>If you would like to attend any of these courses, please <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/243a06162f214eb6b26c9d77631cd731}\" title=\"Contact us about stoolball\">contact us</a>.</p>"
