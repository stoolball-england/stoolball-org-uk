If you're going to coach children to play stoolball at school, you must have a DBS check and coaching qualification. The school will ask to see them, even if you're with someone else who is qualified. If you appoint a Child Protection Officer, you must ask for a check for them too.</p>\n<p>Even if you've already been checked, perhaps with the local cricket or football club, you need a separate check for stoolball. Stoolball England can arrange a DBS check for stoolball. If you'd like us to arrange your check, <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/243a06162f214eb6b26c9d77631cd731}\" title=\"Contact us about stoolball\">contact us</a>.</p>\n<p>You can find out more about the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service\">Disclosure and Barring Service on GOV.UK</a>.</p>\n<h2>Policies and procedures</h2>\n<p>Stoolball England has developed policies on safeguarding, child protection, recruitment of volunteers and data protection. Many of the same issues apply to your team, so you can read our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/f5f80765ace14b14b4456175402a38fb}\" title=\"Policies and procedures\" data-anchor=\"#\">policies and procedures</a> to help you write your own.</p>"
