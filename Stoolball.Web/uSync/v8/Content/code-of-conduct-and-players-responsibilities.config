Whilst watching your children play stoolball, we would ask you to keep the following in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The children are not competing to satisfy your ambitions</li>\n<li>The children are involved in stoolball for their enjoyment - not yours</li>\n<li>You have the responsibility to encourage the children to keep to the rules of stoolball</li>\n<li>Teamwork and effort are as important as winning - you should accept losing without undue disappointment</li>\n<li>Do not allow a winning side to gloat over their victory</li>\n<li>Never ridicule or shout at a child for making a mistake or losing - praise the things they have done well, or keep quiet</li>\n<li>Set an example - applaud good play by both teams</li>\n<li>Never publicly question an umpire's decision - never doubt his or her honesty</li>\n<li>Verbal abuse and racial abuse are entirely unacceptable in stoolball, and against the law</li>\n<li>Recognise the value and importance of the adults who are coaching you, they are giving up their time for your enjoyment</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Players' responsibilities</h2>\n<h3>Clothing</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Please look smart when you are playing in a match</li>\n<li>Do not wear anything that is valuable, in case it gets lost or stolen</li>\n<li>Ask the adult in charge of your team to find a secure place for mobile phones, money and discarded clothing and so on</li>\n<li>Stoolball equipment is expensive, take good care of it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Timing</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Be early, rather than late</li>\n<li>If you are unwell, or going away, let your team manager know in good time</li>\n<li>After the match, if you did not come with your parents, get ready quickly, your team manager has probably got other things to do.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Behaviour and attitudes</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>No bad language please, on or off the field. It isn't necessary, it's immature, and most spectators are offended by it</li>\n<li>Always respect your opponents, even if they seem not to be respecting you</li>\n<li>If your team manager is giving you advice or discussing tactics, listen to what is being said, without interruption</li>\n<li>The umpires are in charge of the game; do not argue with them even if you do not agree with their decisions</li>\n<li>Bad behaviour of any kind will not be tolerated.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Jewellery</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>It is advisable that rings should be removed before the match, if possible, or at least covered with an adhesive plaster.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Sportsmanship</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Winning is a good feeling, think about how the opposition feel about losing</li>\n<li>Congratulating your opponents is a sign of strength, not a weakness</li>\n<li>Always clap a batsman on to the field</li>\n<li>Remember to thank the umpires and scorers at the end of the match; they have given up their spare time to officiate at your match.</li>\n</ol>"
