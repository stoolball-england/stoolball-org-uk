Because of COVID-19 restrictions, these were via an online meeting.</p>\n<p>Stoolball England’s aim is to develop a team of freelance Coaching Trainers who will deliver exciting, creative and inclusive stoolball sessions. The training programme will enable Coaching Trainers to deliver course content in a classroom environment as well as practical coaching on the ground. Coaches will develop and deliver stoolball sessions at their own pace and fitting-in with their work-life balance. Coaches’ own continuing professional development (CPD) will be expected and encouraged by Stoolball England. Coaching Trainers will help develop this exciting, new programme.</p>"
