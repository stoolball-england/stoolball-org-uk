In an age where class distinction ruled society the young women who played for the Butterflies came from all walks of life. The daughters of the vicar and the owner of Glynde Place played alongside those of the gamekeeper, farm labourer and clerk to the local chalk pits.</p>\n<p>The Revd William de St Croix, vicar of Glynde, compiled the first rules of stoolball in 1867 and published them in the East Sussex News in November of that year.</p>\n<p>The first captain of the Butterflies was Gertrude, daughter of Henry Brand, the owner of Glynde Place. In 1868 she scored the first century at stoolball, making 110 against the Chailey Grasshoppers. This match was played in Glynde Park and, as there were no boundaries, Gertrude ran all 110 runs, a total of one mile, plus all the runs scored by the woman batting at the other end. All this in full conventional dress and wearing the compulsory hat that fashion dictated.</p>\n</div>",
