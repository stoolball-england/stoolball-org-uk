Always use a soft ball, divide into two teams and off you go! You might want to print these rules and stick them to the back of your wicket as a reminder.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mark out a large playing area. Set up the wickets in the middle,16 big paces apart (13 for juniors). Mark a line to bowl from, 10 big paces away from the batter’s wicket.</li>\n<li>The captains start by deciding how many <strong>overs</strong> (8 bowls per over) will be played, who will field first and who will bat first. Or just set a time limit.</li>\n<li><strong>The batter</strong> hits the ball and aims to score as many runs as they can. Run down the left side of the strip and at the same time your batting partner runs to the other end. Touch the wicket when you get there to score a run. Run as many times as you can. Good communication with your partner is vital so that you don’t get run-out!</li>\n<li>If you hit the ball to the edge of the playing area, you score 4 runs. If it didn't touch the ground on the way, you score 6 runs.</li>\n<li><strong>The bowler</strong> bowls underarm only, with 8 balls per over (not counting no balls and wides).</li>\n<li>A <strong>no ball</strong> is when you bowl below the line on the wicket post. The batting team gets 1 run and you have to bowl another ball. The batter can hit a no ball and score more runs.</li>\n<li>A <strong>wide ball</strong> is when you bowl a ball too high or wide for the batter to hit. The batting team gets 1 run and you have to bowl another ball.</li>\n<li>If you think a batter is <strong>out</strong> you must appeal to the umpire by shouting ‘How's that?’ A batter can be out in 3 ways:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Caught</strong> (you can’t be caught out on a no ball, but you can be run-out)</li>\n<li><strong>Bowled</strong> (the ball has hit the square on the wicket)</li>\n<li><strong>Run-out</strong> (the ball is thrown or placed on the front or the sides of the square wicket face before the batter touches the wicket).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The bowler and wicket-keeper should move to the wickets when the ball is hit, making sure they are standing on the same side as the ball. The fielder should throw the ball to either the bowler or the wicket-keeper who tries to run-out the nearest batter. Fielders shouldn't run to the wicket with the ball as they may dangerously collide with a batter.</li>\n<li>Halfway through the match, swap over so that the fielding team gets to bat and the batting team gets to field.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Most importantly: Have fun!</strong></p>"
