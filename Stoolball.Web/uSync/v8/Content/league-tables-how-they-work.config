      "text": "<p>We can work out your league table for you automatically. It'll save time for your results officer, and encourage more interest in your league as players watch the season develop.</p>\n<p>With a league table that’s updated as soon as each result is published, players come to the website to see not only where their own team stands, but also which matches between other teams are going to be important.</p>\n<h2>How easy is it?</h2>\n<p>If you'd like us to work out your league table, first you need to let us know how your league awards points. Most leagues work like this, so tell us whether yours is the same:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 points for a win</li>\n<li>1 point each for a tie</li>\n<li>Nothing for a loss</li>\n<li>1 point each for a cancelled or abandoned match which is not replayed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next we need to know the results of your matches. Although anyone can add matches and results to the website, it works best if your league assigns someone the responsibility for updating the website. This might be your existing results officer, or the home captain for each match.</p>\n<p>When you get your fixture list at the start of the season, add all of the matches to the website. If the right teams aren't listed in your league, let us know and we'll add them. When each match has been played, add the result. It's important that every result gets added, including rearranged matches, otherwise the league table will be wrong.</p>\n<p>For the league table you need only name the winning team, and you can add all the latest results in one go. If you add scores too you'll see detailed statistics for every team – see <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/a2c5e9eb47e54d77a1edce30c57b21ad}\" title=\"How to add match results\">how to add match results</a>. To share this out you may wish to have one person responsible for naming the winner quickly, and another for adding scores when they have time.</p>\n<p>Once you've added the result, your league table will be updated straight away.</p>\n<h2>What if a match is cancelled?</h2>\n<p>If the match will be replayed, set the result to “postponed” and no league points will be awarded. If it won't be rearranged set the result to “cancelled” and points will be shared according to the rules you gave us.</p>\n<h2>What if there are matches missing?</h2>\n<p>The league table is only as up-to-date as the results you add. But if you're too busy one week, we'll list the outstanding matches so there's no confusion over whether the table has been updated yet.</p>\n<p>The list helps your results officer chase up missing results too.</p>\n<h2>What if a team withdraws from the league?</h2>\n<p>If a team withdraws from the league in mid-season, just let us know. We'll change the table to move the withdrawn team to the bottom, and all points won by or against that team will be discounted. See the <a href=\"/competitions/mid-sussex-mixed-league/2011/results\">Mid Sussex Mixed League, 2011 season</a> for an example.</p>\n<h2>What if we need to award bonus or penalty points?</h2>\n<p>We can do this for you. Tell us the name of the team, how many points, and the reason and we'll update the table. The reasons for any adjustments will be listed below the table so that everyone can understand why they were made.</p>\n<h2>Ready to get your league table online?</h2>\n<p>When you're ready, <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/aa129a9df99d4554a0c926d209536a06}\" title=\"Contact us about this website\">contact us</a> and say you want your league table worked out automatically. Tell us which league it is, and how you award your points (see above) and we'll set it up for you.</p>\n<p>If you've any suggestions for improving the tables, or you think your league's a little different and won't work, please <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/aa129a9df99d4554a0c926d209536a06}\" title=\"Contact us about this website\">contact us</a> with the details. We'll do all we can to make it work for you.</p>"
