It was sent to us by Sybil Voller of Bluebells Stoolball Club, who found it among some stoolball papers.

The fact that it is so adaptable to special requirements is its main recommendation to the Fitness Campaign”.</p>\n<p>Information has recently been requested from a sportsman in Lisbon who wants to start the game in Portugal.</p>\n<p>The Organiser of Physical Training of Coventry reports that many schools are energetically playing the game and has written for explanation of some points in the rules that are ambiguous to some of the players.</p>\n<p>Last August “The Queen” gave a full page article with Illustrations.</p>\n<p>From the “Jernal” of John Burgess of Ditchling (Sussex) he wrote on 17 August 1789 that he went to Brighthelmstone “to see many divertions which included Stoolball”.</p>\n<p>The game has been introduced into Patna, India by a former member of the West Tarring Club.</p>\n<p>The Girls of the Royal School for Deaf and Dumb at Margate are enthusiastic players.</p>\n<p>In the report of Organised Sport in York Elementary Schools, we read “that stoolball was an excellent game for Juniors, and could be played on almost any ground without much preparation, and provided a good style of play is developed and not the purely negative style sometimes seen, some thrilling sport can be had”.</p>\n<p>We have received a letter from a well-known doctor in Holland who wrote “I demonstrated this game in the Oranje-Nassau barracks in Amsterdam to groups of the Dutch Red Cross Organisation”.</p>\n<p>By the gracious permission of Their Majesties, the “Not-Forgotten Association” held garden parties in the grounds of Buckingham Palace last autumn and many ex-soldiers enjoyed the game of stoolball.</p>\n<p>The dates for the matches between Sussex and Kent this season are at Tunbridge Wells on Wednesday 14 June and at The Saffrons, Eastbourne on Wednesday 20 September.</p>\n<p>Fynvola Bruce<br />President<br />Stoolball Association for Great Britain</p>\n<p>6 April 1939</p>"
