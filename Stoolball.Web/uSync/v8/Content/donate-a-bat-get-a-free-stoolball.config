It doesn't matter what condition the bat is in - even bats broken in two can sometimes be repaired and used again. If you've got old stoolballs that are still usable, an old set of wickets, or other equipment you don't need any more we'd love to have that too.</p>\n<p>As well as getting a new stoolball for your team, you'll help spread the sport. We'll refurbish your equipment and lend it to schools or clubs which want to start playing stoolball, but need a little help to get started.</p>\n<p>To donate your bat or any other equipment, or if you're just starting out and would like to borrow some second-hand equipment, please <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/243a06162f214eb6b26c9d77631cd731}\" title=\"Contact us about stoolball\">contact us</a>.</p>"
