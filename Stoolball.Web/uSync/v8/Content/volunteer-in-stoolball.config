      "text": "<p>Stoolball is a sport run by volunteers, and getting involved can be really rewarding. You could learn a new skill, gain the experience you need to get your next job, build the future of our historic sport while the kids go to school, or stay active and give something back when you retire.</p>\n<h2>The simple things</h2>\n<p>Everyone can do the simple things. Put up a poster in your front window, in the local shop or your staff room at work. Put a sticker in your car window. Make sure people have heard of stoolball and know they can join a local team. These ideas and more are on our <a href=\"/{localLink:umb://document/6de19ba3220d409695f71249f8638000}\" title=\"Promote stoolball and find new players\">Promote stoolball and find new players</a> page.</p>\n<h2>Help your local club</h2>\n<p>Every club relies on volunteers to keep going.
