// Assistant = Preferred heading font from Google Fonts, similar to Futura at 600

// Don't use Futura on Mac even though it's there and we're trying to look like it, because at this weight it's extra-bold and very different.

// shift while loading web fonts is not an issue for option elements, which are hidden by default when the fonts are loading,
// so remove that and replace it with a better fallback. Chrome/Edge will just use Mada as they should.
