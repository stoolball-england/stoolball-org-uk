# Design

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is used as the basis for the CSS, primarily for its familiarity for anyone coming to the project. The SASS version of Bootstrap is used to avoid including too much unused CSS.

Icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) are used, unchanged, according to the [FontAwesome licence](https://fontawesome.com/license), and embedded as SVG with appropriate accessibility attributes.
